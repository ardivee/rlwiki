# Dummy Assets

---

###### Dummy assets are used as a reference to the in-game files, this way we can use pretty much everything that's in the game!

#### Installation

---

###### - Download one or more packages listed below and place them in your ```UDK/UDKGame/Content``` folder
###### - Open UDK
###### - Go to your Content Browser and right click on your package and press `Fully Load`
###### - After it's done loading ( May take a bit the first time) you can drag them into your scene

#### Limitations

---

###### You cannot edit the assets, since it's only used as a placeholder

#### Packages
